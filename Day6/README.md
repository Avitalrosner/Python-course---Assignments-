Hi :)

In this assignment I've uploaded an Excel file, conteinting:
 1. The number that represent each patient.
 2. The type of cancer the patient has.
 3. The sum of UMI's that was received from the RNA seq data.

I have calculated the log10 for the sum of UMI's for each patient, so that it would be easier later on with the analysis.
